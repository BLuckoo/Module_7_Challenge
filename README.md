## Overview of the Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to provide the Pewlett-Hackard HR Manager with the correct information to plan for upcoming retirements and ensuring that there are enough employees to fill the upcoming vacant positions.
To do so, data modelling, engineering and analysis techniques will be used on data originally kept in Excel and CSV files which have been transferred in tables using SQL.

The analysis will provide the HR Manager with the number of retiring employees per title and identify the employees who are elligible to participate in a mentorship program.
