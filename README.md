## Overview of the Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to provide the Pewlett-Hackard HR Manager with the correct information to plan for upcoming retirements and ensuring that there are enough employees to fill the upcoming vacant positions.
To do so, data modelling, engineering and analysis techniques will be used on data originally kept in Excel and CSV files which have been transferred in tables using SQL.

The analysis will provide the HR Manager with **the number of retiring employees per title** and **identify the employees who are elligible to participate in a mentorship program.**

The SQL concepts used in the analysis is comprised of:
- joining multiple data tables using common fields to the tables (known as primary keys) being joined
- using conditional statements to filter certain data out of the queries
- a SQL statement known as UNIQUE is being used to exclude duplicate data
- the data presented is being sorted using SQL statements
- the required data is being saved and provided to the HR department in Excel files in CSV  format.
